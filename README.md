###Slime incremental RPG

Basically, you're a slime that gains stats and changes elements. Go through the world and get stronger through paradigm shifts.

Normal > Grow bigger to max size > max determined by unlocks and stats > king slime size > President slime?
Shedding like snake for growth > poop out the weak parts> concentration > lose stats to gain growth.

Elements
Water, air, fire, ice, elec, holy, evil, non-elemental, nature, undead, metal>gold, earth, chi(kung fu slime?)

High multi elements unlocks other > High air+fire > elec -- High earth + elec + non > metal
Or through low chance events/hurting your slime. Eg. Get struck by lightning, jump in a fire...

Manually change your element- change takes time, later becomes faster/instant?

Revisit zone for more effects (fire element in starter zone? Shit burns, rots, freezes, blossoms)

Gaining affinity to elements might have negative effects on other affinities.

Large or full screen scroll. Pixel art.

Random events/encounters - Weather/ other monsters / heroes / bosses

Getting 'killed' just makes you reconglomerate slowly. Makes idling in zones useless to start.
Heroes kill you easily unless you run, eventually be able to take them on. Heroes come in various classes/levels depending on area. Eg. Starter area > plains would have lvl 1 knight relatively avg dmg/ high def, but slow, fairly easy to run from. Forest > rangers > high damage hard to run from. Mages > telegraph what spell they use so you can change your affinity?

Perhaps make your character have an Experience amount tied to them. So, if you're powerful, stronger heroes will seek you out to kill you. Maybe have to balance your exp worth to avoid running into heroes, later use certain forms to bait heroes. Eg. If you're in a big form or king slime, your worth more experience. More so for metal/gold slime, and stronger heroes will seek you.

Multiple maps, for grinding various zones. Entering certain zones will be too hard to start.
eg. Volcano will melt you until you get high fire/def stat.
Classic areas > Plains, forest, mountain, cave, frozen north, desert, ocean/lakes, etc.

Real death (have to figure out how to actually die) of slime goes to heaven/hell > can't do much first few times > reincarnate, stats reset, better gains.
Eventually be able to grind heaven/hell areas for stats.

Places to steep for idle. (Hot spring > water + fire. Swamps, ice water, Monster church holy basin, )

Mini games for stats? STR (dmg), Def - increase brane, can become bigger without loss, spd/dex - crits/run, Cha? - Int - using elements.

Eventually buy buildings with gold (other resources?), offer small idle benefits. EG. buy a gym > offers x idle benefit at all times, and an x multiplier to minigame training. 

Gold is a useless resource to start. Having high gold amounts will make high level heroes hunt you.

Eventually absorb earth. Essentially, a reset, as buildings and other stats won't matter. Multiple planets, stars, solar systems, avoid black holes to start (lose progress) - you're more absorbent? eat black hole too (add gravity, condense). Galaxies, superclusters.

Start to absorb small things, bacteria, small insects, move through huge blades of grass, grow until you're at the start of the first game.
